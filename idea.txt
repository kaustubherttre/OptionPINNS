So the idea remains: On the fly neural nets.
    *Get an excel import
    (Work with prediction models only)
    *Let the user chose predictable colums
    *Let the user remove colums that are not needed for the net, dates, sno
    *Do a shapley test if the columns exceed 20
    *Allow the user to create the neural net(later)
    *Package everything and run the neural net
    *Get the final h5 file, ask the user if the want to test a file.
    *User uploads test file(check if it different from the inital uploads, matching colums, prediction variable not present, run the model)
    *Get visulaization, if not correct let the user customize their nets

This is made for people who have some knowledge of neural nets, BA, DA, PA.
